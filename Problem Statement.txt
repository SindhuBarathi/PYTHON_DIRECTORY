Write your code in poc.py which I have created.

All files are in folder RAW_DIR.

Task:
1. Create two directories which are "good_data" and "bad_data".
2. Files that follow "poc1.csv"  or similar name structure and if that file is not empty then it should move to "good_data" folder and other files 
    should move "bad_data" folder.
3. Before moving correct file to "good_data" folder, rename the file by adding todays date at the end of the file
    Example: "poc3_day_month_year.csv".
